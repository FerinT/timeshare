How to run this bad boy for the first deliverable..

1. import the script to populate the database in phpmyadmin \timeshare\php\dataaccess\scripts\timeshare.sql
2. run the page /timeshare/DisplayAdverts.php

More Info:

DisplayAdverts.php calls the page AdvertDetails.php when you click on the link.
You will notice that there are some duplicate classes with a '1' at the end, this is due to refactoring. 
The only difference between service1.php (The one currently in use) and service.php is that we added value objects in Service1.php 
ServiceDAO1.php (The one currently in use) was my attempt at using a join to construct a Service1.php object (with the schedule and user value objects) this only contains a select all for now
